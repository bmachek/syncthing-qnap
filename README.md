# syncthing-qnap

## State
This is work in progress.

## Requirements
This is designed to be run with QNAP QDK locally available, i.e. on a QNAP NAS.
Possibly this will work on a different Linux distribution with QDK available, but for now it hasn't been tested.

## Usage
Example
```
cd syncthing-qnap
./build.sh 1.25.6
```



## Thanks 
Based on the work of @Catfriend1 :-)
